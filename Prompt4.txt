Question #4: Checking for Uniqueness
Write an algorithm that determines whether all the elements in a string are unique. You may not convert the string into an array or use array methods to solve this problem. The algorithm should return a boolean.

Example
Input: "hello"

Output: false

Input: "copyright"

Output: true

PSEUDOCODE:
- I want a way to count to the number of times an element appears -- maybe an object?
- I want to loop through and check if each element exists in the object yet
- if it doesn't exist yet, I want to add it to the object
- if it does, I want to break out of the loop and return false

function unique(string) {
  let counterObj = {};
  for(let i = 0; i < string.length; i ++) {
    const char = string[i];
      if (counterObj[char]){
        return false;
      } else {
    }
    counterObj[char] = true;
  }
  return true;
}
